Rea Vaya Mobile App Prototype

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to develop a mobile application for Rea Vaya's transportation system that addresses the issues faced by both new and old commuters, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of service. The proposed app will provide a user-friendly platform to facilitate easy travel account top-ups, card retrieval with existing funds, real-time bus tracking, and essential information dissemination.
